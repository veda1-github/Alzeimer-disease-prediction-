### Project Overview

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for managing the disease and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data and other features to detect Alzheimer's Disease effectively.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes medical imaging data and other relevant features for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models.
